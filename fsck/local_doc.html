<ul>
  <li>
  <b>Step 1</b><p></p>Rescapp searchs for all the partitions based on information found in <i>/proc/partitions</i> file. If the partition contains an: <i>/etc/issue</i> file it will also obtain the distribution name.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 2</b><p></p>Rescapp presents you found partitions on Step 1.<p></p>You are prompted:<p></p>
  <i>Which partition?</i><p></p> You are supposed to choose whatever partition you want to force filesystem check and press the OK button.<p></p>Explanation of description is:
    <ul>
      <li>
	<b>Distribution name</b>: Your distribution root partition has been detected and you are seeing its name.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b>Not detected</b>: The partition can be mounted but there is not a <i>/etc/issue</i> fie on it. Probably a non root partition.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b>Can't mount:</b>: The partition cannot be mount. Maybe it is the partition you want to fix, another one that Rescatux cannot mount, or probably a SWAP partition.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 3</b><p></p>While the fsck process is being run the following message is displayed:<i>Running forced filesystem check and fix</i>
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 4</b><p></p>You are informed about the fsck process.<p></p>Message is self explanatory. You either get:<p></p><i>Success! Filesystem check with automatic fix was OK! :)</i><p></p>or<p></p><i>Filesystem check with automatic fix went wrong! :(</i>
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 5</b><p></p>You should click OK on the <i>Running forced filesystem check and fix</i> window.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 6</b><p></p>A log file called <i>fsck.log.txt</i> can be found at Desktop <i>logs</i> folder.
  </li>
</ul>
