<ul>
  <li>
  <b>Step 1</b><p></p>Rescapp searchs for partitions that have on them the following file: <i>/etc/issue</i> based on information found in <i>/proc/partitions</i> file.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 2</b><p></p>If such partitions have been found Rescapp presents you partitions that have on them the following file: <i>/etc/issue</i>. At the same time you are prompted:<p></p>
  <i>Which partition is your main GNU/Linux?</i><p></p> You are supposed to choose your main GNU/Linux distribution (probably you only will see one) and press the OK button.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 3</b><p></p>You are prompted:<p></p><i>Which user?</i><p></p> Select the desired user from the list.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 4</b><p></p>You are prompted:<p></p><i>Enter password (user)</i><p></p> Use a temporal password please. You will change it later on your system.
  </li>
  <b>Step 5</b><p></p>Rescapp tries to changes the password for the selected user.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 6</b><p></p>You are informed about the password change process.<p></p>Message is self explanatory. You either get:<p></p><i>Password was changed OK! :). We recommend to change it once you're back in your system to use your system default encryption</i><p></p>or<p></p><i>Failure! Password was not changed. Something went wrong! :(</i>
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 9</b><p></p>A log file called <i>chpasswd.log.txt</i> can be found at Desktop <i>logs</i> folder.
