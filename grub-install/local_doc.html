  <b>Step 1</b><p></p>Rescapp searchs for partitions that have on them the following file: <i>/etc/issue</i> based on information found in <i>/proc/partitions</i> file.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 2</b><p></p>If such partitions have been found Rescapp presents you partitions that have on them the following file: <i>/etc/issue</i>. At the same time you are prompted:<p></p>
  <i>Which partition?</i><p></p> You are supposed to choose your main GNU/Linux distribution (probably you only will see one) and press the OK button.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 3</b><p></p>Rescapp searchs for hard disks present on your system based on information found on <i>/proc/partitions</i> file.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 4</b><p></p>You are prompted:<p></p><i>Which hard disk to install Grub on?</i><p></p> You are supposed to take a look at hard disk sizes (to be able to identify your hard disks) and choose (usually) the one that it is set to be first one to boot at your BIOS settings.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 5</b><p></p>You are prompted:<p></p><i>Order hard disks according to boot order. Press OK to continue.</i><p></p>. Take a look at hard disks and their sizes. Order the according to BIOS boot order and then press OK.
  </li>
  <b>Step 6</b><p></p>Rescapp with all gathered information is going to create a temporal device.map at your Linux installation (which will be deleted later) and try to install grub on your selected hard disk thanks to your own distribution grub-install command.<b>Please wait</b>. Currently (Rescatux 0.23) this step is time consuming but no Please wait message has been implemented.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 7</b><p></p>You are informed about the grub installation process.<p></p>Message is self explanatory. You either get:<p></p><i>Grub was installed OK! :)</i><p></p>or<p></p><i>Failure! Grub was not installed. Something went wrong! :(</i>
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 8</b><p></p>A log file called <i>grub-install.log.txt</i> can be found at Desktop <i>logs</i> folder.
  </li>
</ul>
