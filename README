== Rescatux live cd unique features ==

These features might be already merged into upstream live-build or they will be asked to be merged there.
These features is what make different Rescatux than a regular live-cd which has Rescapp package installed.

* Rescapp package included (which includes self-test)

* Rescatux startup wizard:
** Appears by default centered between two screens (useful when one has a broken screen)
** Change monitor settings
** Change language/locale
** Change keyboard layout
** Turn off VNC Server or change its password

* Lightweight desktop (lxqt)

* Includes both 686 and amd64 kernels
* Arch autodetection in Isolinux bootloader
* Arch autodetection in Grub2 bootloader
* Microsoft signed Secure Boot
* Loopback.cfg support
* SElinux support
* Liveid
* VNC Server on by default


== OBTAIN SOURCE CODE ==

You can obtain most recent source code from out git repository by issuing:

  git clone https://github.com/rescatux/rescatux.git rescatux-git

== BUILD INSTRUCTIONS ==

In order to build Rescatux in a Buster system or Buster chroot you need these packages:

live-build (patched as below)
imagemagick # Needed for logo generation
syslinux # Needed for logo generation
syslinux-utils # Needed for logo generation

If you want to build also source code you need the git package to be installed.

== Rescatux's live-build ==

I'm trying to push upstream (live-build) my improvements on live-build:

* Arch autodetection in Isolinux bootloader
* Support for loopback.cfg
* SElinux
* Liveid

in the meanwhile you need to get, build and install live-build's live-build package from:

https://github.com/rescatux/live-build/
(Tag: rescatux-0.73rc1-tmp1)

Then make sure you install:
policycoreutils
coreutils
selinux-utils
selinux-policy-default
packages so that SElinux support works ok.

== Rescatux's live-boot ==

I'm trying to push upstream (live-boot) my improvements on live-boot:

* Liveid
.

Rescatux live-boot will be fetched from Rescatux repo when building the rescatux disk.

Were you to need to build it manually (and upload to a repo of your own so that it's taken into account) you can have its source code here:

https://github.com/rescatux/live-boot/
(Tag: rescatux-0.75b5-tmp1)

Note: Make sure you build both the i386 buster and amd64 buster versions.

=== Isolinux based image ===

Edit these variables from make_common file if needed:

MIRROR_BOOTSTRAP
MIRROR_CHROOT
SID_MIRROR
BACKPORTED_PASSWD

Using an Buster system or chroot run at the Rescatux source code directory:

  ./make-rescatux.sh

This will generate an image like:
  rescatux-0.30b7.iso
in rescatux-release directory.

=== SG2D based image ===

(Note: At March 2020 this feature won't work properly without being updated.)
(Note: So this is an unsupported script.)

You need to have installed GNU GRUB2 in your system, at least the grub-mkrescue and grub-mkfont binaries.
You also need to have Super Grub2 Disk source code.

Edit SG2D_SOURCE_DIRECTORY variable in make-rescatux-sg2d.sh file.
Its value should be path to your Super Grub2 Disk source code directory.

Using an unstable/jessie system or chroot run at the Rescatux source code directory:

  ./make-rescatux.sh

  and then:

  ./make-rescatux-sg2d.sh

This will generate an image like:
  rescatux_cdrom_usb_hybrid_i386_486-amd64_0.30b8_sg2d.iso

=== Make source code ===

Just run:

  make-rescatux-and-source-code.sh

which will generate many source code files at:

rescatux-release/rescatux-VERSION/source-code directory.

=== Release ===

The files that usually conform a release are:

Rescatux iso:

  rescatux-0.30b7.iso

Rescatux iso md5sum file:

  rescatux-0.30b7.iso.md5

Rescatux source code:

  rescatux_source_code_0.30b8.tar.gz

which will be found on:

rescatux-release directory.

=== Other notes ===

You can change Rescatux version at VERSION file.
