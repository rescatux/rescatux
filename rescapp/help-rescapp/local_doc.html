This is Rescapp. The main Rescatux UI.
<p></p><IMG SRC="images/help-rescapp_001_full_window.png"><p></p>
We are going to make a tour through its options. The first thing you should know is that you can always go back to the first Rescapp screen thanks to the <b>MAIN MENU</b> option.
<p></p><IMG SRC="images/help-rescapp_002_main_menu.png"><p></p>
If you happen to need help is good to know that at the upper left part of the UI the <b>Support options</b> are located.<p></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Chat</b>: Open Xchat window so that can you ask help on the Rescatux IRC channel.</li>
  <li><b>Share log</b>: Generates a pastebin from an existing log file so that can ask help in the chat window with your data at hand.</li>
  <li><b>Help</b>: Opens the help you are currently reading just in case you're not sure of something</li>
</ul>
<p></p><IMG SRC="images/help-rescapp_003_support_options.png"><p></p>
Below the main menu and support options you will find the <b>group options</b>. That is options that have other options inside.
<p></p><IMG SRC="images/help-rescapp_004_group_options.png"><p></p>
You might choose the <b>Grub(+)</b> option which will lead you to Grub options.
<p></p><IMG SRC="images/help-rescapp_005_grub_options.png"><p></p>
Once there you can see <b>Restore Grub</b> option. Clicking on it will show its information on the bottom web-browser alike tab but it will not run it.
<p></p>
If you want to run it you will have to click on the name of option plus !!! option. In our example you will have to click on <b>Restore Grub !!!</b>.
<p></p><IMG SRC="images/help-rescapp_006_restore_grub_selected.png"><p></p>
While navigating through the different options the <b>Back</b> option will appear so that you can go back to previous menu.
<p></p><IMG SRC="images/help-rescapp_007_back.png"><p></p>
You have to know that apart from the options found thanks to the Rescapp UI there are <b>other tools</b> announced in Rescatux. These tools will probably be found thanks to the Start menu. These tools are not supported by Rescatux team so they are supposed to be used by <b>experts</b> even if they are easy to use.
<p></p><IMG SRC="images/help-rescapp_008_tools.png"><p></p>
Finally we will learn how to shutdown Rescatux. The powerdown button is found at the right bottom corner.(I inside O).
<p></p><IMG SRC="images/help-rescapp_009_powerdown1.png"><p></p>
You will then be prompted what you want to do. Either you will select Shutdown to turn off your computer or reboot to use it inmediately.
<p></p><IMG SRC="images/help-rescapp_010_powerdown2.png"><p></p>
Finally you are asked to remove your media (cdrom or usb) from your computer and press a key to continue so that the computer can be shutdown or rebooted.
