<br/>
This option can sometimes help if a disk utility, OS, or BIOS doesn't like the CHS values used by the partitions in the protective or hybrid MBR. In particular, the GPT specification requires a CHS value of 0xFFFFFF for over-8GiB partitions, but this value is technically illegal by the usual standards. Some BIOSes hang if they encounter this value. This option will recompute a more normal CHS value -- 0xFEFFFF for over-8GiB partitions, enabling these BIOSes to boot.

<ul>
  <li>
  <b>Step 1</b><p></p>Rescapp searchs for hard disks on your computer.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 2</b><p></p>If such hard disks have been found Rescapp presents you the hard disks. At the same time you are prompted:<p></p>
  <i>Which hard disk?</i><p></p> You are supposed to choose the hard disk which has a GPT partition which you want its hybrid MBR CHS to be recomputed.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 3</b><p></p>Rescapp with all gathered information is going to recompute the CHS for the hybrid MBR inside your GPT hard disk.<b>Please wait</b>. Currently (Rescatux 0.40b1) this step is time consuming but no Please wait message has been implemented.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 4</b><p></p>You are informed about the hybrid mbr CHS recompute process.<p></p>Message is self explanatory. You either get:<p></p><i>Success! Hybrid MBR CHS was recomputed OK! :)</i><p></p>or<p></p><i>Failure! Hybrid MBR CHS was not recomputed. Something went wrong! :(</i>
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 5</b><p></p>A log file called <i>gpt-recompute-hybrid-mbr-chs_log.txt</i> can be found at Desktop <i>logs</i> folder.
  </li>
</ul>
