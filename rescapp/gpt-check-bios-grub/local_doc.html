Do you actually need a bios_grub partition ? It depends. A bios_grub partition is usually needed if you use grub-pc on a GPT disk. If your computer has both a GPT disk and EFI boot support you might be better on trying to install grub-efi package. If you need to use grub-pc package on a GPT disk after all this option let's you find if your targeted hard disk has the bios_grub partition or not. If you think that you need to create a bios_grub partition please ask to your distribution usual support places. An option to help you to create a bios_grub partition is not on the short term Rescatux TODO list.

<ul>
  <li>
  <b>Step 1</b><p></p>Rescapp searchs for hard disks on your computer.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 2</b><p></p>If such hard disks have been found Rescapp presents you the hard disks. At the same time you are prompted:<p></p>
  <i>Which hard disk?</i><p></p> You are supposed to choose the hard disk which has a GPT partition which you want its bios_grub partition to be checked.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 3</b><p></p>Rescapp with all gathered information is going to check if there is a bios_grub partition inside your GPT hard disk.<b>Please wait</b>. Currently (Rescatux 0.40b1) this step is time consuming but no Please wait message has been implemented.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 4</b><p></p>You are informed about the bios_grub checking process.<p></p>Message is self explanatory. You either get:<p></p><i>bios_grub partition was found! :)</i><p></p>or<p></p><i>bios_grub partition was not found. :(</i>
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 5</b><p></p>A log file called <i>gpt-check-bios-grub_log.txt</i> can be found at Desktop <i>logs</i> folder.
  </li>
</ul>
